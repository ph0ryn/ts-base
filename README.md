# ts-base

Reusable TypeScript base template for small ESM projects.

This repository is intentionally minimal. It provides strict TypeScript defaults,
pnpm-only dependency management, Oxlint, ESLint, oxfmt, and Git hook integration
without prescribing an application framework.

## What Is Included

- ESM package setup with `"type": "module"`.
- `src/index.ts` as the default source entry point.
- Strict `tsconfig.json` with `noEmit` enabled.
- Oxlint type-aware linting and type checking.
- ESLint rules for TypeScript naming conventions.
- oxfmt formatting configuration.
- Git hook integration through `lint-staged`.
- pnpm workspace catalog for tool versions.

## Requirements

- pnpm `10.33.0` or compatible.
- Node.js capable of running pnpm tooling.
- Bun-compatible ESM runtime if you use the default `"module"` entry directly.

This template enforces pnpm during install. Do not use npm or yarn.

## Getting Started

Use this repository as a template, then adjust the package metadata and scripts
for the project you are creating.

```sh
pnpm install
```

After cloning or creating a new repository from this template:

1. Rename the package in `package.json`.
2. Decide whether the generated project should stay private.
3. Replace `src/index.ts` with the new project entry point.
4. Add project-specific `dev`, `build`, `test`, or release scripts as needed.

## Scripts

Run all commands from the repository root.

| Command           | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm install`    | Install dependencies and configure Git hooks.    |
| `pnpm run lint`   | Run Oxlint type-aware linting and type checking. |
| `pnpm run format` | Run lint fixes, oxfmt, and ESLint fixes.         |

## Project Layout

```text
.
├── src/index.ts          # Default source entry
├── eslint.config.mjs     # ESLint configuration
├── oxlint.config.ts      # Oxlint configuration
├── .oxfmtrc.jsonc        # oxfmt configuration
├── .githooks/            # Git hooks
├── package.json          # Scripts and package metadata
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml   # pnpm workspace and catalog settings
└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript compiler options
```

## Template Notes

- Keep shared defaults generic. Project-specific behavior should be added after
  creating a repository from the template.
- Prefer adding scripts over changing the meaning of the existing ones.
- Keep tool versions in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalog entries unless a consuming
  project has a reason to manage versions differently.
- `package.json` is marked private by default so new repositories do not publish
  accidentally.
